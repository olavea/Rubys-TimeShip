## ðŸš€ The Gatsby Timeship

The code in the main branch are your starter files.

It's a simple form connected to a bare bones time-travel function.

## âœ¨ Quick start

1.  **Get project files**

    It is best if you do not clone this project, instead use the `Code -> Download as ZIP` or `Use this tempate` options above.

2.  **Install dependencies**

    ```shell
    npm run install
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

4.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    - Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!

    Your check if everything is set up correctly function is running at http://localhost:8000/api/hello

    - Edit `src/api/hello.js` to make changes

    Your starter time travel function is running at http://localhost:8000/api/time-travel

    - Edit `src/api/time-travel.js` to change the time travel function.
