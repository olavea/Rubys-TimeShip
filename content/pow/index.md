## Crew Mate!
Captain Ola has been recruiting in stealth mode for 47 days.

Every morning Captain Ola has been building in public, coding on the new POW! website. BUT after lunch ....

**Firstly** Captain Ola asked himself "Self, who is your Number 1 Favourite Crew Mate?

Captain Ola wrote a Top 10 List.

**Secondly**, Captain Ola started interviewing from the top of his Top 10 List. Number 1: Ola's old friend from summer camp deep in the backwoods of upstate New York, back in 1993. A soft spoken Dev with rock solid UX skills.

Half way into that first interview Captain Ola just **KNEW** "Jed Wood **IS** the man I want in my crew on this Life-Long Treasure Hunt of building POW! into a useful tool for devs who also happen to menstruate."

**Thirdly**, after 3 interviews Jed Wood finally said "yes" to join our POW! crew.

**Question:** How crazy is it to add ANOTHER Dev to a two-dev team?! On a scale from 1-to-11?

**Answer:** 11 maybe...

**Fourthly**, we need BETA testers and users of menstrual cycle tracker apps to do user interviews with. Please join our 33 BETA testers by sending an email to Queen Benedicte Raae at hello@usepow.app or send a DM on twitter to Queen Benedicte [@raae](https://twitter.com/raae)

**Fifthly**, Captain Ola must get back to writing another Top 10 List. Our POW! Crew needs a marketer! Right?! POW! needs a Crew Mate who will become our expert on women's health so we can give you all som super content filled with tips and tricks and deep dives into women's health.
