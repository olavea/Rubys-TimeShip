The "Pirate-Devs"
are those who abandon the
deferred dev-life plan of "learning & succeeding after 5 to 15 years"
Create the Pirate-Dev life style in the present. Using the
techniques of the "Pirate-Dev"
- Skill-building &
- Building-in-public &
- Skill-building -in-public
- Free time


Senior engineer dev-skill-set is not
the fantasy.
The fantasy is the dev-life style of complete mastery and  freedom the Senior engineer dev-skill-set supposedly allows you.
