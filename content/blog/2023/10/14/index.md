# Because Fun is Better than Boring

Let's say Fun is your number 1 goal for your side-project. Fun means you gotta do EVERYTHING you can do to make it Fun. Or it'll become boring, you wait and see. These three go together:

- Fun
- Un-opinionated programming in your use-cases you share
- Not Big. Tiny

Read downwards. FUN.

Your side-project is just like Lillian's Lemonade stand on Sunday. So let's start with the hardest part of FUN: Tiny.

## Big Become Boring

Making your side-project Tiny is harder than it looks. You have to remove EVERYTHING except the bare necessities.

So let's start removing one bite at the time. I Lillian started with time.

## Save Time Selling Lemonade

- Make less lemonade, sell less lemonade
- Move to a better location than last year
- Lower the lemonade price from last year
- Give an even lower price for buying 2 cups of lemonade
- Give an even lower price for buying 3 cups of lemonade
- Give an even lower price for buying 4 cups of lemonade
- Give an even lower price for buying 5 cups of lemonade
