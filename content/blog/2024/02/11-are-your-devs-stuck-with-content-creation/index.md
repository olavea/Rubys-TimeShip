# Are your devs STUCK with their content creation? 🤔

Writing a useful technical blog-post is surprisingly hard, especially if you only write a handful each year. Making a technical video is even harder, especially for a dev, introvert or not. But you already know that.

## Imagine your dev publishing REGULARLY & with visible smiles

Playfulness with coding has been our strength for over ten years.

## A live stream is less stress with an experienced dev to help 😃

if your devs get helped with EVERYTHING by a more experienced dev they trust.

## YOUR dev only has to show up on the live stream, if you let MY team do the rest 👩‍🏫


## Let MY team do all the "hard" stuff so that YOUR dev only has to show up and talk to me about everyday work stuff while I live code on with YOUR tool.
