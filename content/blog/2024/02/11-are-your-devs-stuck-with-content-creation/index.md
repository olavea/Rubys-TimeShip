# Are your devs STUCK with their content creation? 🤔

Your dev team’s content creation is stuck. Writing a useful technical blog-post is surprisingly hard, especially if you only write a handful each year, sure. But you know they keep going in circles in their heads about how to do it and procrastinating. You don’t know what to do next. You know you need to make a change, but what change?

(. Making a technical video is even harder, especially for a dev, introvert or not. But you already know that.

## Imagine your dev team publishing REGULARLY & with visible smiles

Playfulness with coding has been our strength for over ten years.

Your devs time is valuable, but not only the time, also the disruption in their day, sitting down trying to do an unfamiliar task like writing
they deserve premium support
would you let your customers try to solve unfamiliar problems with your tool without help and support
