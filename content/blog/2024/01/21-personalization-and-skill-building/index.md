# Personalization and Skill-Building

Ahoy dev!

I don't know about you, but I believe in learning. And I believe the learning we devs best can share with each other isn't tech tricks, but skill-building techniques.

More specifically:

## Personalized Skill-Building Techniques

"What! Personalized skill-building techniques?" you may ask. Well let me ask you this follow-up question:

Could YOUR skill-building fit your personality type better?


## What is Your personality Type?

One way to find out is if you take a personality type test and compare your result with your skill-building techniques.
