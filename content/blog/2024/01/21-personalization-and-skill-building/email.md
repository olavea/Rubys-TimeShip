Ahoy podcast guest!

Whichever area of dev-life you chose for us to focus on there is one common skill I believe is key.

I don't know about you, but I believe in learning. And I believe the learning we devs best can share with each other isn't tech tricks, but skill-building techniques.

More specifically:

## Personalized Skill-Building Techniques

"What! Personalized skill-building techniques?" you may ask. Well let me ask you this follow-up question:

Could YOUR skill-building fit your personality type better?


## What is Your personality Type?

One way to find out is if you take a personality type test and we compare your result with your skill-building techniques.

[THE TYPEFINDERÂ® PERSONALITY TEST](https://www.truity.com/test/type-finder-personality-test-new?ver=control)

Our audience will find our conversation THAT more useful if we do a comparison. At least that's what I've seen in past conversations. I've seen the test make a conversation more specific and thus we can dive deeper down. And maybe come up with some experiments to see if your skill-building COULD fit your personality type better.



## Personality Type and Learning Style

Knowing your personality type I'll be able to ask you questions that might reveal for example:

- A time when your personality type made it easier for you to leverage one of the strengths of your personal learning style.

- A time when your personality type and your personal learning style were good friends.

- A time when you adapted a task to fit your personality type

- A time when you adapted a situation to fit your personality type
changed one factor

It is enough that the two of us know your personality type we don't have to tell the audience, if you think it to personal


A good step one is to find what personality type you are. There are several tests, but this one is free and good.



My life's mission is to help devs like you fit your skill-building to YOU and thus empower you to live your dev-life Your Own Way. You know, getting more out of life kinda thing. Or a more piraty dev-life.




## Treasure Hunting for Skill-Building Insights

My way of treasure hunting for skill-building insights is to listen to devs like you tell me about fav personalization techniques. And leading the witness with questions stolen from bleeding edge practice practicioners and leading learning researchers.
