Ahoy podcast guest!

In the three areas of dev-life there is ONE thing I believe is key.

A key kind of learning.

I believe the learning we devs best can share with each other isn't tech tricks, but skill-building techniques. The key to a more piraty dev-life is learning skill-building techniques.

More specifically:

## Learning Personalized Skill-Building Techniques

"What! Personalized skill-building techniques?" You may ask. Yes and let me ask you this follow up question:

## Is there a way to see how YOUR skill-building could better fit your personality type?

Yes maybe, with these two steps:

1. You take a personality type test.
2. We compare your personality type results with your skill-building techniques.

The typefinder personality test is free and only takes a few minutes. And it's optional, more about that soon.

## The personality type test is optional, but

Our audience will find our conversation THAT more useful if you take the test. At least that's what I've seen in past conversations. I've seen the test make the conversation more specific and thus we can dive deeper down. And maybe come up with some experiments to see if your skill-building COULD fit your personality type better.

It is enough that the two of us know your personality type we don't need to tell the audience. And it is enough that the two of us know your personality type we don't need to tell the audience. You KNOWING your personality type makes the difference, not WHICH personality type you have.




## Personality Type and Learning Style

Knowing your personality type I'll be able to ask you questions that might reveal for example:

- A time when your personality type made it easier for you to leverage one of the strengths of your personal learning style.

- A time when your personality type and your personal learning style were good friends.

- A time when you adapted a task to fit your personality type

- A time when you adapted a situation to fit your personality type
changed one factor

It is enough that the two of us know your personality type we don't have to tell the audience, if you think it to personal


A good step one is to find what personality type you are. There are several tests, but this one is free and good.



My life's mission is to help devs like you fit your skill-building to YOU and thus empower you to live your dev-life Your Own Way. You know, getting more out of life kinda thing. Or a more piraty dev-life.




## Treasure Hunting for Skill-Building Insights

My way of treasure hunting for skill-building insights is to listen to devs like you tell me about fav personalization techniques. And leading the witness with questions stolen from bleeding edge practice practicioners and leading learning researchers.
