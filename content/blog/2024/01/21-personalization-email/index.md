Ahoy Dev!

I don't know about you, but I believe in learning. Learning from my fellow devs. My .... belief is that the area a dev can learn the best from another dev is not technical tricks, but skill-building techniques. More specifically:


## Personalized Skill-Building

Could YOUR skill-building be more personalized to fit your particular job situation & personal learning style?

My life's mission is to help devs like you fit your skill-building to YOU and thus empower you to live your dev-life Your Own Way. You know, getting more out of life kinda thing. Or a more piraty dev-life.


## Treasure Hunting for Skill-Building Insights

My way of treasure hunting for skill-building insights is to listen to devs like you tell me about fav personalization techniques. And leading the witness with questions stolen from bleeding edge practice practicioners and leading learning researchers.


## Personality Type and Learning Style

A good step one is to find what personality type you are. There are several tests, but this one is free and good.
