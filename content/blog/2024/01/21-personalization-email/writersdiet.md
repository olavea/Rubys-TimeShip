Ahoy future podcast guest. I don't know about you, but I'm a learning-believer. I believe the learning we devs best can share with each other isn't tech tricks, but skill-building techniques. More specifically: Personalized Skill-Building Techniques. The question "what is Personalized Skill-Building Techniques?" can be answered with another question: Could YOUR skill-building fit your personality type better?

If you take this personality type test, our audience will find our conversation THAT more useful. Because I've seen the test make conversations more specific and thus we can dive deeper down.
