Yeah we started out making a plan, gathering tools and rounding up the team.

## The team is

Lillian Raae-Vea (8 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏) & Ola Vea (me dev)

You've heard people say about building an app, you start by making a skateboard, not the car wheel. So Lillian got the idea to use her skateboard, since we no longer have a car. That makes our tools list:


## Our tools list

- skateboard
- several ropes
- a plastic compartment of a tool box
- mobile phone, for payment
- and last, but not least duct tape.

## Our plan

1. Go down in the park
2. Find a decent christmas tree
3. Pay for said christmas tree
4. Drag the christmas tree home by it's heels
5. Put stuff on the christmas tree
6. Go around the christmas tree singing loudly

And so we did, see photographic evidence.

We sawed off a slice of the christmas tree trunk, as per recipe.

Queen Raae had dug out the christmas tree  foot for us. So we put the christmas tree  in it's foot, watered it. Took off it's red stocking.

removed all the stuff that was in the christmas tree's corner including mommo's old treasure chest.

We have some old christmas tree lights and when Queen Raae jOIned us we twirled those christmas tree lights onto the tree.

Stuck the christmas tree lights in the electrical socket and they lit up. For five seconds, blinked a few times and shut themselves off.

A closer look at the electrical cabel showed it to be almost completely worn in two.

## Hacking the christmas tree lights

so I sat down with an old scout's knife. Old, but sharp as a tack. And I wittled off the plastic thing that is closest to where the cable joins the electrical socket. And then I tied the cobber bits back together. Then I secured the whole thing with duct tape.
