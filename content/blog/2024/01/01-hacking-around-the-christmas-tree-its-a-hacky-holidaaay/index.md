Yeah we started out making a plan, gathering tools and rounding up the team.

## The team wass

Lillian Raae-Vea (8 🏴‍☠️👸) & Ola Vea (dev-dad)

You've heard people say about building an app, you start by making a skateboard, not the car wheel. So Lillian got the idea to use her skateboard as a sort of cart to drag the christmas tree on.


## Our tools list 🔧

- skateboard 🛹
- several ropes 🧶
- mobile phone, for payment ☎️
- and last, but not least duct tape. 💪

## Our plan 🗺️

1. Go down in the park
2. Find a decent christmas tree
3. Pay for said christmas tree
4. Drag the christmas tree home by it's heels
5. Put stuff on the christmas tree
6. Go around the christmas tree singing loudly

And so we did, see photographic evidence. Here we buy the christmas tree from nobody, but a piece of paper.

We dragged the christmas tree home singing christmas songs loudly and slightly off key

Back home we sawed off a slice of the christmas tree trunk, as per recipe.

Queen Raae had dug out the christmas tree foot for us. So we put the christmas tree in it's foot, watered it.

Lillian took off the tree's red stocking with scissors.

Then we removed all the stuff that was in the christmas tree's corner including mommo's old treasure chest.

We have some old christmas tree lights and when Queen Raae joined us we twirled those christmas tree lights onto the tree.

Stuck the christmas tree lights in the electrical socket and they lit up. For five seconds, blinked a few times and shut themselves off.

A closer look at the electrical cabel showed it to be almost completely worn in two. The pirate Princess and Queen Raae kept on dressing up the christmas tree,



## Hacking the christmas tree lights

I sat down with an old scout's knife. Old, but sharp as a tack. And I wittled off the plastic thing that is closest to where the cable joins the electrical socket. And then I tied the cobber bits back together. Then I secured the whole thing with duct tape.



## Family and friends came and we danced around the christmas tree

"Uncle" Allister our Captain during the summer and my training buddy the rest of the year.
