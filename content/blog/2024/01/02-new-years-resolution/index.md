Ahoy Shipmate!


Welcome to a Piraaaaty Neeew Yeeear!
And welcome to this spanking new email series. 📟 Hope you like it, this new email is part of our resolution for 2024. Our new year's resolution is to inspire you to *make the most of your dev-life*. By that we mean, help you make your dev-life more PIRATY  in one of three areas. Help you make your dev-life more:

- Piraty at work 🔧
- Piraty at home and 🏠
- Piraty at play 💃

If you'd have to choose one of these three areas of your dev-life to spice up with a pinch of pirateness, would it be at work, at home or at play?

Please reply, as your answer will make it easier for us to get going with our new year's resolution.

We'd LOVE to hear your new year's resolution, so write it in your reply if you dare. 👻

As for our own dev-lives we polished off a playful holiday by filling our house with a piraty party. Soon we'll have an even more prodigious party for Queen Raae's birthday.

So our focus is on piratical play.

Feel free to peruse the piraty writings below at your leisure.
