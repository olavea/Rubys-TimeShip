⛵️ Programatically create pages for tags from Sanity.io

Ship Ahoy Skill Builder!

## My Skill Building Session:
![data-relationships](data-relationships-1-w51-2021.png)


## What did I do?
I followed the "red string" of one tag from the front end of the webapp and all the way to my back end in sanity.io

## Why did I do it?

To make it easier for Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) to finish her projects by shipping them to the internet. And then archiving her projects on my labyrinthine loft.

So she can easier start a new project

## How did I do it?

And that is enough steps for this week, if you want to see Pirate Princess Lillian go and look at my skill building session on youtube. This link starts you 20 minutes into the video, where I show you how the webapp will look in the end.

If you feel like doing me a favour you can give me a smiley emoji comment to feed my youtube algos some vitamins.
