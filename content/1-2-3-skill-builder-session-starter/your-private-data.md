Imagine coding away and for each step you know exactly what to do and you know exactly HOW to do it. Thinking to yourself «Yup. First I do this and then I do that.» Finishing up that step, smiling, sipping coffee while you're builing locally. And:
Success
Success
Success
It works just right. And you're thinking to yourself «Yup. I KNEW that would work. Now on to the next step.»
