## Not sure how to fix your Gatsby problem?

Are unexpected bugs popping up in your Gatsby project? You have Googled. You have looked through Stack Overflow. You have tried to get help in the Gatsby Discord.

## Imagine your Gatsby site working

Imagine this – Imagine your Gatsby project following Gatsby best practices

## An expert code review will get you unstuck

Get Unstuck – Often, all it takes to get unstuck is to talk to the right person at the right time. Put the analysis paralysis behind you. Learn exactly what I would do next. Book a live 1-on-1 coaching call with me now. Why?

- I’ve been running a independent professional dev business for X+ years
- I have delivered 1000+ hours of coding to folks just like you


## Here's How It Works

- In a virtual 30-minute meeting, you present your Gatsby project and the underlying challenges you are having. If you are not the lead developer, bring the lead developer!

- After that, you give me access to your code, and
- I thoroughly go through the whole code base.

After I finish the go-through, we schedule a one-hour review session where I present my "pull request" to your Gatsby project. It's not a real pull request, you'll have to copy paste my code and work on it. But there will be a golden nugget in there that is one of the keys to your solution.

You are free to record this session for future reference.

Book your intro session
2.445 USD with a 100% Money back guarantee.

If you are not happy after the initial call, let me know, and I'll refund your payment in full. No hard feelings!
